This project was my first portfolio project and one that I created around December 2020. 
The project is written using the core web technologies (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript) and hosted using Amazon Web Services.
A special feature of the website is that it uses AWS Lambda, SES, and S3 - allowing for a functional contact form.
There are a few old projects still viewable on the website and you can check them out with the link below.
