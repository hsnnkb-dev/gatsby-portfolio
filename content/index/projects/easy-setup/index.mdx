Check out my first attempt at creating a basic portfolio website using gatsby, 
which has been adapted from netninja's tutorial. 
This project helped me to learn the basics of Gatbsy, graphql and using markdown files to quickly and conveniently generate content.
The project is hosted on Netlify and integrated with the GitHub repository, allowing for efficient continuous integration and Deployment.
